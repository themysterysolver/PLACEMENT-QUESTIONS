## Question 1: ***Bounty***


**Description:**  

- The world government has set a bounty for a pirate, and they want the bounty amount to be represented by an integer containing `N` digits. However, they have a condition that the integer must contain ***at least 2 zeros***.
Your task is to find and return an integer value representing the possible integers that are the perfect fit for a bounty with the above criteria. Return modulo $10^4+7$ .

> Note: The N-digit integer should not contain any leading zeros.

#### Input Specification:

- input1: An integer N, representing the number of digits to set a bounty.

#### Output Specification:
- Return an integer value representing the possible integers which are the perfect fit for a bounty with the above criteria.


**Examples & Constraints:**  
- Example 1:
    - input1: `3`
    - Output: `9`
    - Explanation:Here in this example, the number of digits to set the bounty is $3$ . According to the criteria the Integer must contain *at least 2 zeros* .
      - So, all the possible integers with 3 digits and at least 2 zeros are: 100, 200, 300,400,500, 600, 700, 800, 900
      - In total, there are 9 such integers that meet the given criteria.  
      - Hence, 9 is retumed as the output  
- Example 2:
  - input1: `4`
  - Output: `252`
  - Explanation: Here in this example, the number of digits to set the bounty is `4`. According to the condition the integer must contain *at least 2 zeros* .
      - So, all the possible integers with 4 digits and at least 2 zeros are 1000,1001,1002,1003,1004, 1005, 1006, 1007,1008 1009,1010,1020, 1030,1040, 1050,1060,1070,1080,1090,1100, 1200, 1300, 1400,1500,1600, 1700,1800.........9010,9020,9030,9040,9050,9060,9070,9080,9090,9100,9200,9300,9400,9500,9600,9700,9800,9900
      - In total, there are 252 such integers that meet the given criteria
        - Hence 252 is returned as the output

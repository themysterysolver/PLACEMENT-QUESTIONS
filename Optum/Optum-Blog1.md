## Online Assessment Overview  

- The test was conducted in the `codeSignal` the same platform used by **`VISA`**.
- The test duration was `70mins`,unlike the other DSA question in OA this was different.If u are reading this blog for DSA q,then you can skip it out.Since it's going to be about web dev.
- We logged into to the codesignal then we completed the basic procdure then we were asked to do choose any one among the given tech stacks,
  - Django + Angular
  - Java spring boot + MyBatis
  - Express + React + sequelize
  - C# ASP.NET + React

- Now came the fun part,we were given 4 requirements/features to implement.
- They gave us the initial DB structre,readme,schemas,(frontend)react app,backend logic. It was a well designed file structre for front-end and back-end.
- Now we have to implemeent the above features in the tech stack choosen above.
- The IDE was very user friendly,it was similar to `VS code`. They had terminal to run commands.
- They also had an `AI bot` whihc the game changer here. They told us we can use how muchever we want to use this bot to achieve the end goal. It's name is `COSMO`,it 
was a really strong AI assitance.
